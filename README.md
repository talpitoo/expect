## Quick start

* (optional) Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
* (optional) Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
* Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/talpitoo/expect.git`.
* Go to the newly created folder: `cd expect`.
* (optional) Start Vagrant: `vagrant up`.
* (optional) SSH to the newly created virtual machine: `vagrant ssh`.
* (optional) Go to the shared folder: `cd shared`.
* Pick a task from the [Yeoman generator-webapp documentation](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) e.g.
* `npm install` in case you skipped the virtualbox/vagrant route
* `npm start` to preview and watch for changes,
* `npm run build` to build your webapp for production (the generated static website in the `/dist` folder),
* `npm run serve:dist` to preview the production build.
* Open [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) on your host machine.
* If anything goes wrong, find help on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

Voil√†!
